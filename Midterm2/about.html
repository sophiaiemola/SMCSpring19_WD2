    <h1>Who is Dayglow?</h1>
    <div class="floater-section med-width-50 large-width-50">
        <div class="content-about">
            <p>Dayglow started as an idea that great coffee from around the world should be easy to get. We thought a
                lot about the disconnect between the home barista and subscription companies. Typically there’s a
                selection for everyone but the marketplace gets saturated with too many low tier options and confusing
                descriptions. When you receive your coffee you are then left with nothing but a rough idea of what you
                should taste in
                the cup. At Dayglow you’ll find only the best coffees from the best roasters in the world and we’ll help
                you brew it. As subscribers you’ll have access to training videos, blogs and more. </p>
